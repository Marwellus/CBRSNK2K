Look, mah!

It's crap! But it's mine! X-P

It started as a "Let's just try,
it'll be fun!" retro project and
ended up being this absurd game.

I had no clue, really, what was
awaiting me, being an JAVA/C#-Dev
for almost my entire life.
Segmentation, Interrupts, Ports,
VGA, DMA, Real & Protected Mode, 
DPMI? - What the actual fuck ...

But I kept going, kept getting
beaten for every tiny error
I made, but every punch only
made me fight harder. I wanted
to know if I could make it.
I had to make it ...

It's been an experience
unlike anything before.

Those who once took up arms
against the mighty IBM MACHINE
shall never be forgotten!
*
Their tales must be spread
and told evermore, for they speak
of passion, perseverance,
and lived masochism!
Of battles against interrupts,
memory segmentation,
treacherous API interfaces,
an twisted quirks and glitches!
*
They fought in an age
when nothing was certain
and every stone could only
be set upon shifting ground.
*
A time when archaic gods
mercilessly crushed all
who failed to follow
their countless commandments!
Or even dared to defy
their capricious whims!
*
The battlefield is soaked
with the blood and sweat 
of all those hackers, 
and only few were able
to outwit the gods and ascend
to become true legends!
*
Forget them not!
Forget not how it all once began!

We all stand upon
the shoulders
of giants!
